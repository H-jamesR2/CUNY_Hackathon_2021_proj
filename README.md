  # Project scrapped due to inadequate time
  # Concepts/Considerations:
    # Draw background
    # blue sea with walls -
    # draw particles-might be easier just to make them circles of varying size or blobs
    # figure how to implement arrow keys or any other interactive feature
    # option for the user to chosoe 'player_type' [ or the comupter to chose
    # draw animals-turtle, pacman, shark, -> i'd check the list of endangered species on google -- RU
    # Implement the "facts" [thought bubbles] on the particles so when the animal eats the particle he gains a fact that is blown up on a screen
  # Implementations:
  # Drawings:
