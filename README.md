# CUNY_Hackathon_2021_proj
  Project scrapped due to inadequate time
  ## Concepts/Considerations:
    # Draw background
    # blue sea with walls -
    # draw particles-might be easier just to make them circles of varying size or blobs
    # figure how to implement arrow keys or any other interactive feature
    # option for the user to chosoe 'player_type' [ or the computer to chose
    # draw animals-turtle, pacman, shark, -> "i'd check the list of endangered species on google" -- RU
    # Implement the "facts" [thought bubbles] on the particles so when the animal eats the particle he gains a fact that is blown up  on a screen
  ## Implementations:
  * [x] User can move 'player_entity'
  * [x] Particles are removed in contact w/ 'player_entity'
  * [x] 'Score' and 'Time' is tallied
  
  ## Drawings:
